# Winter_School_Project
The Project of Group 11 for the Winter School. This code was written by Alessandro Buchmann, Lamberto Lesana, Matteo Vercesi and David Montani with the help of Martin Klapper 

In this Project, we aim to save students time and energy by creating a program that takes as an input the name of an Exchange University and returns what courses have been taken there. This will allow students to more easily plan their exchange semesters abroad. 

This project houses a selection of pdf's locally. The application therefore only works with limited queries, but this could be expanded given more time.
